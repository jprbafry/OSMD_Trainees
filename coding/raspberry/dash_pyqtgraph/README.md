# pyqtgraph Dashboard

This is a sensor data dashboard written by pyqtgraph,
that supports fast visualization and interactive GUI component rearrangement.

To run the demos:
```bash
# in first window, at OSMD_Trainees/coding/raspberry/, run:
python -m dash_pyqtgraph.dashboard -n A
# in second window, also at OSMD_Trainees/coding/raspberry/, run:
python -m dash_pygame.mockup_sensors # note: use dash_pygame here, as no need to re-invent the wheels
...
```
